# 🖐️ Hello, welcome to my GitHub!

## 👨‍💻 Who am I?

I’m a developer passionate about technology, automation, and solutions that simplify life! Since 2000, I’ve been exploring the programming world, and my first encounter with RPA (Robotic Process Automation) happened in 2013 when I turned repetitive tasks into efficient solutions — and since then, I’ve never stopped automating everything I see!

## 🚀 What do I do?

I work on developing RPA, systems, and integrations for various industries such as legal, retail, and logistics. My tools range from programming languages like **C#, Python, Node.js** to automation platforms like **UiPath** (advanced level and RPA Solution Architect), **Automation Anywhere**, and **Power Automate**. I also leverage open-source solutions such as **WebClient** and **WebRequest** to create custom bots integrated with databases and responsive systems.

## 🛠️ My specialties:

- **RPA Development:** From administrative tasks to complex integrations with internal and external systems (**Benner**, **Espaider**, **PJE**, **ESAJ**, among others).  
- **Web Crawling:** I gather valuable data while I sleep (or while the bots work)!  
- **Analysis and Reports:** Expertise in Excel to generate automated insights and reports.  
- **Tailored Solutions:** Transforming manual processes into agile and scalable systems.  
- **Negotiations and Optimizations:** Engaging with suppliers, analyzing competition, and developing new products.

## 🏆 What have I achieved?

- Created bots for law firms integrating systems and state courts (**TJRJ**, **ESAJ - AC, AL, AM, CE, MS, BA, SP**).  
- Advanced certification in **UiPath** and solid experience with **Automation Anywhere** and **Power Automate**.  
- Developed automations and integrations for retail and logistics companies, optimizing time and reducing costs.  
- Experience with market systems such as **Benner**, **Santander**, **PJUR**, **Projuris**, and others.

## 🛠️ My Skills:

### **Languages and Tools**  
- **C#, Python, Node.js, VBA**  
- **ASP.NET MVC, WebApi, AngularJS, Bootstrap, jQuery**  
- **Selenium, UiPath (advanced certified), Automation Anywhere, Power Automate**  
- **Databases and integrations with EntityFramework and REST APIs**  

### **Automation and RPA**  
- Developing bots to integrate with legal systems (**Benner, Espaider, Projudi**, among others).  
- Interacting with state courts (**TJRJ, ESAJ - AC, AL, AM, CE, MS, BA, SP, PJE**, etc.).  
- Creating open-source solutions with **WebClient** and **WebRequest**.

## 🌱 What am I focusing on now?

I’m currently enhancing my full-stack development skills, exploring AI applied to RPA, and diving into messaging systems like **RabbitMQ** for microservices architecture. I’m also working on personal game development projects because a good dev always needs hobbies! 🎮
